    "This data was collected by coach of RSU/Dobele futsal team. This is statistics for season 2018/2019. This team plays currently in the Latvian futsal premier league (season 2018/2019 they won 1st league). Studying data os futsal is very interesting. We can discover things that coach eye can't discover! \n",

    "With machine learning coach could discover great players that might not seem as appealing to others and build better team for less money. \n",

    "Also this the coach said that this data set could be improved with giving each oponent team weight based on their position in the league table. And based on that weight we give weigh to the statistics collected. Why? Because when team plays against weaker teams -> more passes, more accuracy, more shots, better goal_coef. But when team faces strong oponent - all the features go down. Very important to see wich player performance suffers the most when he has to play against stronger oponents. But that is for future.. \n"
